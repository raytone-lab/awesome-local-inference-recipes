| Source level | Meaning | Format |
|---|---|---|
| 🏛️ **Official** | vendor or project number | **Model** · Engine `quant` — Hardware → **key number** level \[source\] |
| ✅ **Measured** | poster ran it, with log or screenshot; an engine or recipe author must also publish raw data and reproduction steps | **tok/s** = single-stream generation (not prefill, not aggregate) |
| 🔁 **Relayed** | second-hand, verify upstream | Tiers use the lowest published hardware price (USD) |
| 📣 **Claimed** | projection, no reproduction | Unknown values are never estimated |

## Contributing

One recipe = one PR. Copy the YAML template from [submit.html](submit.html), fill only what the source shows (`null` otherwise), run `node scripts/validate.mjs`, and link the post. Then run `python3 scripts/gen_readme.py` to regenerate all READMEs. Add new models and new hardware in the first few weeks after launch, and non-mainstream combinations, first. Merge a routine repeat recipe into the existing entry. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Dev: `python3 -m http.server 5190` → `index.html` (landing) · `explore.html` (filter/sort/scatter) · schema in [`schema/recipe.schema.json`](schema/recipe.schema.json).
